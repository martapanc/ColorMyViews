# Color My Views

Android "Color My Views" app created with Kotlin, following the tutorial in "[Developing Android Apps with Kotlin](https://www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps-with-kotlin--ud9012)" by Udacity.

### Ideas
- Use images instead of colors, and reveal the images (picture memory game)
- Use one image and break it up into sections to reveal over time
- Get rid of the text and buttons and just fill the screen with boxes (Piet Mondrian's Paintings)
